# CycleStats
 
Simple little program with a Tkinter GUI that allows cyclists who have a Strava account to pull down their information and store it in a Postrgres db. 

At least at the onset of this project, I'd recommend having the Postman Client, Jupyter Notebooks, certain packages, and PostgreSql with the Admin4 tool.


1) Setup your Strava account so it has access to the API. 
2) Follow this tutorial to get necessary activities::read_all permissions
3) Install the above programs
4) Build the Postgres db
5) Install necessary Python packages [stravaIO, pandas, numpy, psycopg2, datetime]
6) Run code
7) [Optional] Automate the Activities and Streams calls to a regular cadence.
